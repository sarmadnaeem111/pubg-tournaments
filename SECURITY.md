# Security Documentation for PUBG Tournaments Web Application

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the PUBG Tournaments web application to protect user data, prevent common web vulnerabilities, and ensure secure authentication and authorization.

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization

- **Firebase Authentication**: Secure user authentication with email/password
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different access levels for users and administrators
- **Session Management**: Automatic session timeout after inactivity
- **Account Lockout**: Temporary lockout after multiple failed login attempts
- **Password Security**: Strong password requirements and secure password reset flow
- **Email Verification**: Verification required for new accounts

### Data Protection

- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive configuration stored in environment variables
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized to prevent XSS attacks
- **Data Validation**: Client and server-side validation of all data
- **Secure Storage**: Encrypted local storage for sensitive client-side data
- **CSRF Protection**: Token-based protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery

### Web Security

- **Content Security Policy**: Restricts sources of executable scripts
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Additional layer of XSS protection
- **Referrer Policy**: Controls information in the Referer header
- **Permissions Policy**: Restricts browser features

### Firebase Security

- **Firestore Security Rules**: Granular access control for database operations
- **Security Middleware**: Additional validation layer for Firestore operations

## Security Best Practices for Developers

### Environment Setup

1. Never commit `.env` files to version control
2. Use `.env.example` as a template for required environment variables
3. Use unique values for all environment variables in production

### Authentication

1. Always use the provided security utilities for authentication operations
2. Never store passwords or sensitive tokens in client-side code
3. Always validate user permissions before performing sensitive operations

### Data Handling

1. Always sanitize user inputs using the `sanitizeInput()` function
2. Validate all data with appropriate validation functions
3. Use the `secureFirestoreRead()` function for database queries
4. Sanitize data before writing to Firestore with `sanitizeFirestoreData()`

### Form Security

1. Always include the `<CSRFToken />` component in forms
2. Use the `<FormValidator />` component for form validation
3. Validate CSRF tokens on form submission

## Security Monitoring and Updates

- Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities
- Monitor Firebase Authentication logs for suspicious activity
- Implement security updates promptly

## Reporting Security Issues
